# 2.21: Installing and Configuring OpenSSH
## Overview

through the browser, I'll be installing OpenSSH onto my host computer and accessing it through the console. This file documents my journey! 

## Steps
Installing OpenSSH is pretty simple. The client OpenSSH app was already installed on my computer, and I had to install the server.
