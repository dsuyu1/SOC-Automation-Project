# 2.2: Installing Wazuh
## Introduction
I set up a Wazuh server in the cloud using [DigitalOcean](https://www.digitalocean.com/). 

## Steps
To begin, I created a "Droplet," or a cloud server, and called it Wazuh.

Next, I set up a firewall to prevent my server from being spammed by external scanners.

<i>Ref 3: Setting up a firewall</i>
<br><br>

In order to block unwanted inbound traffic, I set the firewall only to allow traffic (all TCP and UDP, just in case) coming in from my public IP address.

<br><br>

Next, I configured my server to use the firewall I just created. By entering the `Droplets` tab and going into `Networking`, I added the firewall to my server.
The next order of business is accessing the server. We can access the server via SSH through the web browser by navigating to the `Access` tab.

<br><br>

Accessing the server console via SSH in the browser didn't work for me, so I used [PuTTY](https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/latest.html) instead. I was able to connect easily. I actually tried connecting using the Windows terminal, but I just couldn't get it to work. After trying for three days, I gave up and tried PuTTY, which worked in 2 minutes.

<br><br>

Now, we can finally install Wazuh. We can use this `curl` command to install Wazuh.

`curl -sO https://packages.wazuh.com/4.7/wazuh-install.sh && sudo bash ./wazuh-install.sh -a`

Installing Wazuh gave me a username and password. We can log in to the server by heading to the server's IP address and logging in with those credentials.

Great! I now have Wazuh installed! Next, it's time to install TheHive.
