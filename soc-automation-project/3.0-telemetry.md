# 3.0: Telemetry and Wazuh
## Introduction
My objective this section is to generate telemetry and ingest it into Wazuh. 

## Steps
To start it off, after installing Wazuh onto our Windows 10 client, we're going to go into a file called `ossec.conf` under the folder `ossec-agent`. This configuration contains everything related to Wazuh. We want to look for processes that contain Mimikatz. Under `<!--Log Analysis-->`, we can see which events are being excluded. I'm going to change our `ossec.conf` file to ask it to ingest our Sysmon logs. I also made a backup file in case anything goes wrong.

<!-- make sure to talk about your struggles:
making the Wazuh agent on the wrong computer (I made it on the host not the client)
having trouble getting SSH to work on my host computer, so i downloaded Putty)
