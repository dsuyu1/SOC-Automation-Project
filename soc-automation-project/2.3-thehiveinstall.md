# 2.3: Installing TheHive
## Introduction
After successfully installing Wazuh, it's time to install TheHive.

## Steps
Similar to the Wazuh server, I made a new Droplet (server) and gave it the same firewall.

<br><br>

After setting up the new Droplet, I SSH'd into it and started installing some prerequisites and dependencies. Here are the instructions I followed; I copy-pasted the commands from [here](https://github.com/MyDFIR/SOC-Automation-Project/blob/main/TheHive-Install-Instructions).

After installing everything, we'll go into the cassandra.yaml file to set some configurations. I changed the `listen_address` and `rpc_address` from `localhost` to my public IP address. Next, we'll configure ElasticSearch.
