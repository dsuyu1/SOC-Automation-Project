# 2.1: Installing Sysmon
## Overview
In this section, I will be installing Sysmon onto my Windows 10 virtual client.

Next, I downloaded the Sysmon configuration file that we'll be using. You can find it in [this](https://github.com/olafhartong/sysmon-modular.git) GitHub repo by Olaf Hartong. I'll be using the config file called `sysmonconfig.xml`. After downloading the neccessary files, I'll run Powershell as an administrator and navigate to where my Sysmon files are located.

We need to make sure all the files are in the same directory, including the `.xml` config file.

<br> <br>

We can also verify that all the files are in the same directory using the `dir` command in Powershell.

Currently, we do not have Sysmon installed. We can verify this by 1) going through Services or 2) going into Event Viewer. Let's check is we have it installed.

<br> <br>

According to Services, Sysmon is not installed.
In Event Viewer, we can go into `Applications and Services > Microsoft > Windows` and look for Sysmon.

<br><br>

Looking at the left-hand side, we can see that Sysmon is not there. Let's go ahead and install it now. We can install Sysmon through the command `.\Sysmon64.exe -i .\sysmonconfig.xml`. Note: the `-i` operator is for installations.

<br><br>

Sysmon64 can now be viewed in both Services and Event Viewer! Going into `Event Viewer > Applications and Services > Microsoft > Windows > Sysmon > Operational`, we can start observing our endpoint telemetry!

Now that I've installed Sysmon, it's time to install Wazuh.
